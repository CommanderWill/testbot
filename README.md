# testbot
## "Logistics Officer"

## Quality Warning
This bot "Logistics Officer" is my first Discord bot, C# Project, and my introduction into OOP, The code quality is terrible. 

There is a chance that I rewrite it completely at a later point, but it is unlikely

## Credit
I had help from a from @edwardkopp to get stuff working and they told me I should learn OOP

I used the discord.net documentation and stack overflow to learn how to do a range of stuff in the project

## Using This Code
Feel free to use any code here, in general its not great, some of the best stuff is what I learned and took almost directly from Stack Overflow & the discord.net documentation.

If you use this project for any public project, it would be preferred if you credit this project.

I have removed the serverID file from this project, to add your own, make a file in the main directory called "server_id.txt" and every second line put the server IDs, I have this set so every first line I can put the names of each server
